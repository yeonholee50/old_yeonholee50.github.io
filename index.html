								<p>Hi, my name is Yeon, and I am a current undergraduate and research student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently, I am majoring in computer science with threads in 
									computer architecture and intelligence. I've always wanted to create a personal website where I can not only showcase my projects, but also to discuss my interests outside of school
									Thankfully Github Pages is free, simple, and flexible, so I was able to create this website. Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/yeonholee50" target="_blank"> github portfolio</a>.</p>
								<p>
									I have built many projects through my college career. While projects I worked in class and in my capstone program cannot be displayed on a public repository to protect the academic integrity
									of the institution and NDA for a capstone project, I will share my personal projects that I hope you will find interesting. Here is a link to some of my <a href="#work"> projects</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									Outside of my career, I have a lot of diverse interests. I love to cook and learn about different cuisines.  In my spare time, 
									I play as a midfielder for my school's intramural soccer team and as an intermediate player in chess (just below 1500 ELO). Although 
									these two sports seem unrelated, they are what initially inspired me to pursue computer science as my major from an early age. Currently,
									I am part of my school's RoboJackets team for Robocup where we use small wheeled robots to play 6v6 matches using location and proximity sensors.
									Through my interest in chess is where I first learned about my first AI algorithm, alpha-beta pruning. This is what lead me to choose 
									AI as my thread of interest for my major as well as my current research where we train a deep CNN to interpret 
									sign language.
								</p>

								

								<p>
									Although a lot of my interests outside of computer science seem unrelated at first, all of it seem to lead back to software engineering principles in different fields whether it be developing a backend 
									solution to a repetitive problem or creating a website like this one to help me showcase my skills. To be honest, my interest in computer science wasn't always this clearcut 
									in the first place. I was majoring in computer science during my first semester, but I treated it as a major instead of a passion initially, and it might have been due to the circumstances I was in.
								</p>
								<p>
									Throughout my first year at college, I would work two part-time jobs while barely balancing my academic and social work. As a result, I would regularly sacrifice sleep to finish up homework and to preview for the next day’s lectures. 
									There were often days when I skipped one or two meals to pay for my monthly car loan and textbook fees. As I was unhappy and 
									financially unstable, I felt that something had to change.

								</p>

								<p>
									From desperation, I spent countless hours developing a Python program that engaged with the stock market. 
									Instead of manually trading securities daily, the program does the work by using stock market data and pre-trained 
									mathematical models to predict future stock trends. The program then buys specific corporate shares and sells 
									other securities that the simulation predicts will fall in the next three days. Since its inception in late January, 
									it has returned at least 23% profit each month. Because my Dell laptop made more in three days than I did working 
									as a cashier for three weeks, I quit my job in late March.


								</p>

								<p>
									Nowadays, I am developing a website that allows students to ethically sell their notes with permission from their 
									course instructor for a fixed rate instead of a one time fee. Occasionally, I would think about what my next project 
									should be. If an idea comes, I would jot it down on my whiteboard, but so far the canvas remains blank. I would be 
									lying if I said I had regained my direction in life. Admittedly, I am still exploring. Nevertheless, this experience
									reminded me of why I loved to code in the first place: that feeling of endless possibilities when I made my first 
									program titled “Hello World.” 
								</p>

								<p>
									Maybe I do have something to write down on that whiteboard.

								<!-- LymphaTech - Automatic Head/Neck Circumference Measurement -->
								<h4>LymphaTech - Automatic Head/Neck Circumference Measurement</h4>
								<p>
									My tenure at LymphaTech saw me as a software engineering intern 
									contributing to the development of an innovative backend solution 
									for automatic, low-cost, high-accuracy head/neck circumference measurements. 
									Focused on Lymphedema monitoring, I applied a supervised machine learning random forest,
									 ensuring precision in the measurements through pre-collected data. Additionally, 
									 I played a pivotal role in creating a UI application employing landmark recognition for
									  head and neck clinical measurements. The utilization of advanced algorithms, including 
									  the Harris Corner Detection Algorithm and SIFT pipeline, showcased my expertise in 
									  computer vision. This project not only exemplified my full-stack development skills 
									  but also my dedication to creating impactful solutions in healthcare technology.
								</p>
								<!-- Arduino Hexapod + LIDAR Robot -->
								<h4>Arduino 4-Legged Robot + Two-Camera System</h4>
								<p>
									Embarking on the exciting journey of hardware innovation, I designed and assembled a 4-legged robot featuring advanced capabilities. Using laser printing and adept soldering techniques, I crafted a robot capable of executing fundamental movements in response to remote input. The project's pièce de résistance was the ability to integration of a two-camera system model, enhancing the robot's environmental awareness. Delving into the nitty-gritty, I computed torque specifications and leveraged the analysis to develop a practical application: the robot was adept at transporting personal belongings within a designated basket, showcasing convenience in daily activities. This project wasn't just about building a robot; it was a testament to my proficiency in both hardware and software domains, showcased in a mini computer science exposition.

								<!-- PostedNotes FullStack Development -->
								<h4>PostedNotes Ethical Note-Sharing Platform</h4>
								<p>
									As part of the Create-X entrepreneurial program, I spearheaded the development of PostedNotes, an ethical note-sharing platform fostering collaborative learning among students. Ensuring instructor-approved contributions, the platform aimed at creating a vibrant and collaborative academic community. My role extended from designing a user-friendly frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implementing a robust backend in Python. The development process was transparent and efficient, thanks to GitHub version control. I meticulously tracked platform engagement and note-sharing activity, offering a tangible measure of success in building an interactive and knowledge-sharing ecosystem.
								</p>
								
								<!-- Automated Investment Program -->
								<h4>Automated Investment Program</h4>
								<p>
									In the realm of finance and algorithmic trading, I conceptualized and developed an Automated Investment Program that outperformed static memory points by achieving a remarkable 17% increase in trade accuracy. The decision-making algorithm, programmed in C, optimized memory allocation for hourly data points, demonstrating the project's dynamic nature. I seamlessly integrated the Alpaca trading platform for strategic securities decisions, and proficiency in configuring RapidAPI endpoints enhanced overall program adaptability and accuracy. This project underscored my ability to bridge finance and programming, showcasing my strategic thinking and technical prowess.
